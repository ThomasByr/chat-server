## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

## üî∞ Prerequisites

This project currently suppose you do run a recent enough version of Linux with `pthread` up and ready.

Here you can find the code standard used during dev. The compatibility version corresponds to the minimum version in which the program is guaranteed (the real min version could be much lower) to perform as originally intended regarding the terms and conditions mentioned in [LICENSE](LICENSE) and the [main](src/main.c) source file.

| dev version used  | compatibility version |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| gcc-11            | gcc-9                 |
| -std=gnu17        | -std=gnu11            |
| linux kernel 5.15 | linux kernel 5.13     |
| valgrind-3.18.1   | valgrind-3.15.0       |
| python 3.10.4     | python 3.9.12         |

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Usage

Compile and run a release version with

```bash
make run-release
```

Alternatively `make release` will produce a release version of the executable, `make debug` a debug one, `make run-release` will compile and then run a release version, `make run-debug` will compile and run a debug version with valgrind, and finally `make` is a binding for building the debug version. You can run an existing executable with `make run`, and clean with `make clean`.
